# Shopping Cart Speedbiking
As you don't want to touch every grocery item many times

Improve on this already rather brilliant [Bike-Portable Shopping Cart](https://www.instructables.com/id/Bike-Portable-Shopping-Cart/)

Some directions for improvement:
- A little quicker to put it on and off the bike
- Be able to do that operation while sitting on the bike
- Maybe use bamboo instead of the PVC parts, or other environmental improvements
- Put teasing slogans on it and a good URL; e.g. "parking at the door, lifting no more", speedshopwheels.com
- Make it transparent, just in case someone at the store wants to check if you've scanned everything. Though maybe for sun reasons you prefer white.

What if you don't even have to go to the store?
Without filling neighborhood with hurried deliverers?
Have deliverer service many people (almost) simultaneously, which might ask for some changes in design of transport vehicle or trust relation.
Only works for time&place where many customers already appear anyway: elementary school. BUT, ...
as we want less cars, not more, we HAVE to make sure to forbid cars (or flood the space with people and delivery cargo bikes) there&then (just a short while is  enough)
